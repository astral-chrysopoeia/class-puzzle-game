This is a basic puzzle game that I made for GDT115, and is my first Godot game project.
I started off this game following a tutorial by Paper Mouse Games on YouTube, though quite a bit of the project I made from scratch myself.
The player sprite sheet is made by Paper Mouse Games, and the font I used comes from Kenney. All other sprites sprites are made by me.
